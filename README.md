## Hello! 
I'm Oliver Thornhill, a recent Georgia Tech graduate in Aerospace Engineering, and I'm using GitHub as a place to hold some of my projects. At the moment, I don't have much to show off, but I'm working to try to transfer my Matlab programming skills over to Python. To tell you a little about myself, I'm a tremendous space nerd (hence the aerospace) and a lover of history. 

## Projects
### Dumaresq
A Dumaresq is an analog computer, first invented in 1902, designed to solve the fire control problem - that is, the delicate art of trying to hit another ship with shells when you're moving, they're moving, and the shells are moving. It's a complex problem, one that a lot of very smart people worked with when lives were on the line, and my interest in naval history in that period drew me to it. Hopefully, my Dumaresq project will work its way, piecemeal, toward a solver for the fire control problem. I've got a lot of ideas buzzing around in my head about it. 

I hope to learn a lot about GitHub and Python while working on this problem, in addition to potentially brushing up on some aerospace fundamentals. Stay tuned if you want to see (or cringe at) my early fumbling through Python coding or if you want to see me blather on about naval history and what sources I've managed to dig up on my quest. At the very least, I have the saving grace of not having to machine my computer. All I have to do is program it. 

### Aerospace Calculators
At the moment, this is only my shock calculator, shocking, but I hope to make a few more basic calculators as practice, foundations for future projects, and maybe even something for other people to use.
